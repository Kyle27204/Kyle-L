# Kyle-L
This is my GutHud assignment
my first zip file is Lundgren4. This assignment taught me how to use code to inlcude clicking my mouse to change the color of the shapes. It also taught me how to change the color of one of the shapes by hovering around the bounderies
My second zip file is Lundgren7.zip. This one taught me how to make imanimate shapes move across the screen in a specific way, as well as make shapes from the mouse as it moves along.
My final zip file is Lundgren8. These coding practices taught me how to include images both in the coding and in the zip files.
